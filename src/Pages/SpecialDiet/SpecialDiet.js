                        <h3>Boiled Chicken</h3>
                        <span>If you've ever caught yourself in need of a rotisserie chicken but didn't have one, then knowing how to boil chicken will be your saving grace. With no time (or energy) to run to the store, boiling chicken is the perfect way to get to tender, juicy chicken that's easy to shred. Perfect for pulled chicken sandwiches or chicken salad sandwiches (my fav), you can dress it up any way you like. It doesn't have to be bland or boring as the name suggests. Plus, boiling is faster and less work than cooking in a skillet. It's as easy as bringing a pot of water to a boil . </span>

                        <h3>Bread Salads</h3>
                        <span>Bread has been a staple food in the Mediterranean region for millennia, and even though they didn't have modern preservatives, they found ways to preserve it, such as drying it out, so it could last for weeks or even months. Dried, stale bread was as common as fresh. Folks developed creative ways to use their loaves; think of it as the way we might use dried pasta or instant ramen. Dishes like panzanella and gazpacho (which is a bread soup, not a tomato soup!) were the result.</span>

                        <h3>Healthy Fruits</h3>
                        <span>Two decades ago, the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) study tested the effects of three different diets on almost 500 participants over eight weeks. The first diet was a typical American diet, relatively low in fruits and vegetables (3.5 servings daily) and high in junk foods and sweets. The second offered more fruits and vegetables (8.5 servings daily) as well as seeds, nuts, and beans, and not many sweets. The third was the very healthy DASH diet, rich in fruits and vegetables (9.5 servings daily), beans, nuts, seeds, and whole grains, and barely any sweets. Participants truly stuck to each diet plan. </span>
